1. verify that data sent from js to python via websockets is in the right format to train
2. verify that training algorithm is working correctly / converges to a better solution
3. Export trained model to a file (via the stack overflow - link) so that tensorflow-js can load it from the link and unpack it
4. Get tensorflow js in the browser to implement current trained model to make decisions (and use a pretrained model for starting from) for the game agent
5. Profit!
6. 5 P in vim repeats the action 5 times!
